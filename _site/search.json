This finding is significant as it suggests a gender disparity in AP exam performance, indicating that males, on average, achieve higher scores compared to their female counterparts. These results emphasize the importance of exploring and addressing the potential factors contributing to this disparity, such as societal expectations, educational opportunities, and biases.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe analysis of the data set revealed that Asians outperformed other racial groups on 35 out of the 37 AP tests examined. This finding highlights a significant academic advantage for Asian students across a wide range of subjects. However, in the specific AP tests of Language and Culture and Spanish, Latinos demonstrated higher scores compared to other groups, suggesting their strength in language-based assessments. Whites generally ranked second in performance, followed by Latinos in third place, and blacks in fourth place."

    "text": "Mathematical formula\nThe mathematical formula of the model used in the code is a simple logistic regression model. In logistic regression, the log-odds of an event occurring (in this case, passing the test) is modeled as a linear combination of predictor variables. The formula for the logistic regression model can be represented as:\nlog(p / (1 - p)) = β₀ + β₁ * x\nWhere:\np is the probability of passing the test x is the predictor variable (in this case, it is a constant term of 1) β₀ is the intercept or bias term β₁ is the coefficient associated with the predictor variable\nTo obtain the probability of passing the test, we apply the inverse logit (also called the logistic function) to both sides of the equation:\np = 1 / (1 + exp(-(β₀ + β₁ * x))\nIn the code, the model is fitted using the stan_glm function with the formula cbind(num_females_passed, num_females - num_females_passed) ~ 1, which means we are modeling the number of females passed against the total number of females. The intercept term (β₀) represents the log-odds of passing for the reference group (non-females), and the coefficient (β₁) represents the difference in log-odds between the reference group and females.\nBy transforming the log-odds to probabilities using the plogis function, we obtain the estimated probabilities of passing the test for females, black individuals, and the combined category of female and black individuals over time."

    "text": "Final Thoughts\nSelection of Illinois -\nThe decision to focus on Illinois was driven by two factors. Firstly, the data obtained from Kaggle required proper formatting, leading to a shift towards exploring outcomes within the state. Secondly, the project aimed to examine the odds of success for minority students specifically within Illinois, acknowledging that this percentage reflects the state’s context. It is important to note that when comparing the findings to national data, a notable difference becomes apparent. By centering the analysis on Illinois, this study seeks to provide valuable insights into the educational experiences of minority students and contribute to the understanding of regional dynamics and disparities.\nTying it to issues with minorities in the education system -\nThe findings underscore the discrepancies in test success rates between different groups, notably women and people of color. Females and black people had lower observed probability, indicating probable disparities and problems in the school system. The Bayesian analysis and posterior probability give insight on potential improvements and solutions to these discrepancies.\nCombating the issues -\nThe findings emphasize the need for targeted efforts and interventions to support and empower minority groups, including females and black individuals, within the education system. Strategies can include promoting diversity and inclusion, providing equal access to resources and opportunities, and addressing biases and stereotypes. It is essential to develop supportive learning environments, foster mentorship programs, and offer educational initiatives that encourage participation and success for all students, regardless of gender or race."

I next cleaned the data, deleting any missing values and discrepancies in the variables relating to gender, race, and AP test results. This enabled me to make the first two graphs and discover trends in the data set. The graphs clearly showed that there was a gap between race and gender in the AP examinations, prompting me to create a model in which I may find an exact percent that I could extrapolate to findings of my prior models."

The initial step involved removing columns that discussed variables such as race, focusing solely on the gender-related data. Next, specific attention was given to selecting and aggregating the average scores rather than the count of students per score level. This process ensured that the graph accurately represented the average scores. By cleaning and cutting the data to include only the relevant variables and specifying the desired aggregation, a clean and focused dataset was obtained, enabling the development of a meaningful data model for the graph.\n\n\nAverage Score In Respect To Race\nTo create a graph addressing the average score in respect to race, data manipulation was necessary. The initial step involved removing columns that discussed variables such as gender, focusing solely on the race-related data. Next, specific attention was given to selecting and aggregating the average scores rather than the count of students per score level. Furthermore, certain race categories such as American Indian/Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander, and mixed races were excluded due to aggregation challenges arising from the quantity of data. This cleaning and cutting of the data allowed for the development of a meaningful data model, enabling the creation of a graph that effectively addressed the average score in relation to race.\n\n\nFinal Model\nIn the analysis of the probability of being a woman and black and passing the exam, we focused on the relevant variables by selecting only the women and black columns from the dataset. Using this subset of data, we calculated the percentage probability by dividing the number of women and black individuals who passed the exam by the number who took the exam. This allowed us to quantify the likelihood of success for this specific group. By employing this data modification and mathematical model, we gained valuable insights into the probability of passing the exam for women and black individuals."
