## About Me

Hi, my name is Rishvanth Amsaraj and I am a senior at Metea Valley High School. I aspire to be a business owner with interests in the fields of Data Science, Supply Chain Management, and Finance. As a student, I found great interest in the topic of AP scores in relation to gender and race. This project was a great experience for both learning Data Science as well as exploring a topic I am passionate about. 

If you have any questions about the project, please mail me at - Rishvanthamsaraj@Gmail.com
